Team: Sudoku Terminators
Project: Solving Sudoku

System Requirements:
1. Linux (We have not tested this only on Windows or Mac).
2. Python 2.7
3. Latest version of PyGtk and related libraries

How to run:
1. For the UI run 'python Sudoku.py'
2. To run the rules implementation use RulesVersion.py
3. For Norvig's implementation use ConstraintVersion.py

Use with Python 2.7

Other puzzles can be imported to use in testing. Test puzzles should be in .txt documents and contain
81 integers, using 0s or .s for spaces that need to be solved. The program only reads the numbers 0-9 and . 
for the puzzle values, so they can be spaced to be human readable using any other characters.
